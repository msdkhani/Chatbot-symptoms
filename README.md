### Impact
Leveraging advanced large language models (LLMs), our chatbot offers a user-friendly interface to simplify healthcare navigation. A 2019 survey revealed that 63% of patients struggle with the healthcare system, facing issues like understanding treatment options (51%), finding the right doctor (49%), and comprehending medical costs (47%). Complexity and unclear roles of healthcare providers add to these challenges, particularly for marginalized communities, resulting in significant healthcare inequities and nearly $320 billion in annual spending. Additionally, the fragmentation of healthcare into over 120 specialties makes finding the right care difficult. Our chatbot addresses these issues by using LLMs to identify the relevant physician based on symptoms. It considers the userâ€™s location and insurance details to recommend suitable doctors and facilitate appointment bookings, ensuring timely medical intervention and improved health outcomes. By bridging the gap between patients and healthcare providers, our chatbot enhances healthcare accessibility, particularly in low-resource regions, aiming to significantly improve patient care.
### Use

### What Was Used in This Project
- **LangChain**: LangChain is used as the core framework for building the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent. It facilitates the creation and management of the language model interactions, ensuring smooth integration between the various components such as document retrieval, prompt crafting, and response generation.


- **LangServe**: LangServe is used to deploy and manage the agent as a web service. It handles incoming user queries, interacts with the Chroma database, and manages the workflow of querying the language models and retrieving relevant information.

- **langchain_nvidia_ai_endpoints, NVIDIA AI Foundation endpoints**: This package is used to integrate NVIDIA AI Foundation endpoints with LangChain. It provides access to NVIDIA's advanced AI models for embedding generation, document ranking, and large language model (LLM) interactions.
 relevant documents based on user queries.

- **NVIDIA NIM API (meta/llama3-70b)**: This API provides the large language model used for generating the final response to the user's query. It processes the crafted prompt and produces a coherent and accurate answer.
